# COVID-19-FRANCE

Hi! I'm a first-year undergraduate student in psychology and language sciences at UCL. 

This year, I discovered the programming language R, and since then, I've been trying to learn as much as I can, about data science especially.

Given the current COVID-19 situation, and my newly found interest, why not get my hands dirty with some COVID-19 data?

I'm still at a basic level in programming as a whole, but hey: trying to improve! :)

Here, I attached both the original data frame I used, downloaded from https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/covid-19-coronavirus-data/resource/55e8f966-d5c8-438e-85bc-c7a5a26f4863 , as well as the modified data frames I worked on. 

I encountered a problem with "knit" and my R markdowns: so I attached the plots I coded ("Plot A...") in word documents.

Stay safe :)
